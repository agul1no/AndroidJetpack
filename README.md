Inspired on this conference "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjlhSDhFwzM&t=410s"
2019 about debudding tricks in android studio I have developed this game.
This is a mobile Android Application design with the newest Android Jetpack Libraries and with a MVVM Design Pattern. 
In this game it is all about evading the candies that fall from the top while you are flying up with android.
You can increase your score while you survive longer or you catch some points. You can also collect hearts and restore your lifes.

This App uses Navigation Components, View Binding, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and Room for a caching strategy. 
This Application is still being updated. A server database is being developed to store the points of all the players so can share your score with the community.
